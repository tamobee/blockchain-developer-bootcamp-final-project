## Idea #1: Marketplace for Vintage Cars

Concept: Owners can register their vintage cars and mint their respective NFTs. Owners can display their rare vintage car NFT in the gallery or list it for sale. 

1. User can register their vintage car including all relevant data to store in the IPFS and generate a URI (will work out the details later).

    ```function registerCar(string maker, uint year, string model) public {}```

2. 

## Idea #2: Crowdfunding Platform

Concept: A user can create a campaign for their cause on the platform and incentivize(Tokens, NFTs, etc) other users to donate.
